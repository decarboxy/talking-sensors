talking-sensors
===============

There's a severe lack of lab sensors (temperature, ph, etc) for the visually impaired that aren't insanely expensive/over-engineered.  This project aims to become a platform for interfacing arbitrary analog sensors to a Rasberry Pi and providing an audio based interface for interacting with them.
